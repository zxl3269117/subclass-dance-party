# subclass-dance-party
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair. 

In this project, I created different type of dancers from a Dancer Class using the inheritance patter of Javascript Classes. I also added animation and interactions between dancers, mouse and dancers, and button for line up.
